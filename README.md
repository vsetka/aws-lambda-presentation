# AWS Lambda presentation

AWS Lambda functions - what do they do? Do they do things? Let's find out! I'll give a general overview of what AWS Lambda is, how it works, what are the up and downsides and talk about our experience after having one in production for almost two months. This talk will focus on AWS Lambda and only touch on its alternatives and serverless architecture.
